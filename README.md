# CompiladohDuMineirin  

Compiler developed by [Igor Fran√ßa Negrizoli](https://github.com/igorFNegrizoli) and [Mateus Karvat Camara](https://github.com/MahatKC) in 2022 as an assignment for a Compilers class. It compiles code written in the Mineirin# programming language designed by them in a Programming Languages class taken in 2020.

The Compiler performs Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic analysis in panic mode (which exibits error messages but does not stop compiling whenever an error is found), generating Intermediate code at the end of it.
